'''Learing about Python comments'''


'''
Comments are used to leave notes in code for future readers of the code -
including yourself!


Single Line Comments
--------------------

Any text that comes after a '#' is considered a comment and will be ignored by
Python when we run the program.


Multi Line Comments
-------------------

Triple-quoted strings can be used for multi-line comments. This can be useful
for long comments like this one. It can also be useful to disable entire
sections of code instead of putting a '#' at the beginning of each line.
'''

# Running this program will not do anything because there is no code - there
# is only comments, which are ignored
