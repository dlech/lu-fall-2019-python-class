'''Learing about basic data type'''

'''
We leared that "integers" are whole numbers, e.g. 0, 1, 2, 100, 9392, etc.

We leared that "floats" are numbers with a decimal point, e.g. 2.4, 0,5, 1.0, etc.

We leared that "strings" are just text and that we have to put quotation marks
around them. We can use single quotes (') or double quotes ("), e.g. "hello",
'world', etc.

import turtle

# Many functions will allow an integer or a floating point number.
turtle.right(90)
turtle.right(22.5)

# some functions use strings
turtle.shape('turtle')
