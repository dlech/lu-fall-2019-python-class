Mu is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing code. It is
available to download for free from the link above.

We are using Mu in the *Python 3* mode.

We covered the following topics:

- [Comments](./01-comments.py)
- [Importing modules](./02-imports.py)
- [Calling functions](./03-function-calls.py)
- [Basic data types](./04-data-types.py)
- Basic drawing
  - [Draw a square](./05-square.py)
  - [Draw a triangle](./06-triangle.py)
  - [Draw a circle](./07-circle.py)
  - [Change the color](./08-color.py)

The class concluded with a challenge to try to write your name on screen using
the drawing functions that we learned today.
